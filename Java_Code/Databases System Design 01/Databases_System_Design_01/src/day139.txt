1️⃣ What is an Index? (Think logically)

👉 An index is like the index of a book.

Without index → database reads every row

With index → database jumps directly to matching rows

📚 Book example
If a book has 1,000 pages and you want “SQL Index”, would you:

Read every page? ❌

Use the index page? ✅

Same idea in databases.

2️⃣ Why Indexes Are Used

Indexes are used to:

✅ Speed up SELECT queries
✅ Reduce full table scans
✅ Improve performance on large tables

Without index:
Database checks rows one by one

With index:
Database uses a sorted structure (B-tree) to find data fast

3️⃣ How Indexes Improve Performance

Let’s say we have this table 👇

employees table
id	name	salary	department_id
1	John	50000	1
2	Sarah	60000	2
3	Mike	55000	1
...	...	...	...
❌ Query WITHOUT index
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary = 60000;


👉 Database scans every row
⏱️ Slow when table is big

✅ Add Index
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_salary
ON employees(salary);


Now run the same query again.

👉 Database uses the index
⚡ Much faster

4️⃣ When NOT to Use Indexes (VERY IMPORTANT)

Indexes are not free.

❌ Avoid index when:

Table is small

Column changes frequently

Column has few unique values (e.g., gender: M/F)

Why?

Because every time you:

INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE


👉 Database must also update the index
👉 That makes writes slower

📌 Rule:

Indexes speed up reads but slow down writes

5️⃣ Index Syntax (Simple)
Create Index
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_salary
ON employees(salary);

Drop Index
DROP INDEX idx_employee_salary;

6️⃣ Best Places to Use Indexes ✅

Indexes work BEST on:

✔ WHERE
✔ JOIN
✔ ORDER BY

Let’s see each with examples 👇

7️⃣ JOIN Example (Very Important)
departments table
id	department_name
1	IT
2	HR
JOIN Query
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.id;


👉 This join compares:

employees.department_id

departments.id

✅ Add Index for Faster JOIN
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_dept
ON employees(department_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_dept_id
ON departments(id);


Now JOIN becomes much faster 🚀

8️⃣ ORDER BY Example
SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary;


If salary is indexed 👉 database can sort faster

9️⃣ Final Practice (Your Task)
🔹 Step 1: Write JOIN query
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.id;

🔹 Step 2: Add index to JOIN column
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_dept
ON employees(department_id);

🔹 Step 3: Understand performance impact
Action	Speed
SELECT with index	⚡ Fast
INSERT	🐢 Slower
UPDATE	🐢 Slower
DELETE	🐢 Slower
🔟 Simple Golden Rules (Remember This)

⭐ Index columns used in WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY
⭐ Don’t over-index
⭐ More indexes ≠ faster database
⭐ Always index foreign keys


--------------------------------Practice Basic Level Queries---------------------------------------


CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer
ON orders(customerNumber);

CREATE INDEX idx_payments_customer
ON payments(customerNumber);

CREATE INDEX idx_customers_customer
ON customers(customerNumber);

//created index check yes i have then directly index threw that was a get value not check each row for that
SELECT o.customerName, p.amount
FROM customers o
JOIN payments p ON o.customerNumber = p.customerNumber
WHERE p.amount < 1000;

DROP INDEX idx_orders_customer ON orders;
DROP INDEX idx_payments_customer ON payments;
DROP INDEX idx_customers_customer ON customers;
