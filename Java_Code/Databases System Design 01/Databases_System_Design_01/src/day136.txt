🗓️ DAY 1 — SQL Basics + Table Relationships (Foundation)

1️⃣ What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to:
Store data
Retrieve data
Update data
Delete data

2️⃣ Tables, Rows, Columns
A database stores data in tables.
📊 Table
Like an Excel sheet.
➡️ Columns
Define what kind of data
Example: id, name, salary
➡️ Rows
Actual data records
One row = one entity (one employee)
Example table employees:
id	name	salary
1	John	60000
2	Sara	45000

3️⃣ Primary Key (PK)
A Primary Key:
Uniquely identifies each row
Cannot be NULL
Cannot repeat
Example:
id INT PRIMARY KEY ->👉 Think of it as a unique ID (like Aadhaar / Employee ID).

4️⃣ Foreign Key (FK)

A Foreign Key:
Creates a link between two tables
References a Primary Key in another table
Example:
department_id INT,
FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id)->👉 FK = relationship builder

5️⃣ Table Relationships
🔹 One-to-One (1–1)
One record in Table A matches one in Table B
Example:
users → user_profiles
🔹 One-to-Many (1–Many)
One record in Table A matches many in Table B
Example:
One department
Many employees
departments (id) → employees (department_id)

6️⃣ Why Joins Are Needed
Databases split data into multiple tables to:
Avoid duplication
Improve performance
Keep data clean
Problem without JOIN:
Employee table:
employee_name | department_name | department_location
(Repeated department data many times ❌)
Solution:
Separate tables + JOIN them when needed ✔️

7️⃣ SQL Core Concepts
🔹 SELECT
Used to fetch data
SELECT name, salary
🔹 FROM
Specifies the table
FROM employees
🔹 WHERE
Filters rows
WHERE salary > 50000

8️⃣ Practice Queries (VERY IMPORTANT ✅)
1️⃣ Get all columns
SELECT * FROM employees;
2️⃣ Get specific columns with condition
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;

9️⃣ Simple JOIN Example (Why FK Exists)
Tables:
employees
id	name	department_id
departments
| id | dept_name |
Query:
SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.id;



--------------------------------Practice Basic Level Queries---------------------------------------

SELECT * FROM customers;

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE creditLimit>50000;

SELECT customerName,phone FROM customers JOIN orders on customers.customerNumber=orders.customerNumber;
