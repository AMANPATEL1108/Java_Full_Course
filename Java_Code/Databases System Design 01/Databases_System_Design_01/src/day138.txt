1. Multiple JOINs (what you already wrote – ✅ correct)

Used when data is spread across more than two tables.

SELECT o.id, c.name, p.product_name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.id;


What’s happening

orders is the base table

Join customers to get customer info

Join products to get product info

Each JOIN adds more columns, not more filters

2. Self JOIN (table joins to itself)

Used when rows in a table relate to other rows in the same table.

SELECT e1.name AS employee, e2.name AS manager
FROM employees e1
JOIN employees e2
  ON e1.manager_id = e2.id;


Key idea

e1 = employee

e2 = manager

Aliases are mandatory or SQL gets confused

3. JOIN vs WHERE condition (important distinction)
JOIN → defines relationships
WHERE → defines filters
❌ Bad / old-style (don’t do this)
SELECT *
FROM orders o, customers c
WHERE o.customer_id = c.id;

✅ Proper JOIN
SELECT *
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
  ON o.customer_id = c.id;

JOIN + WHERE together (very common)
SELECT o.id, c.name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
  ON o.customer_id = c.id
WHERE c.country = 'USA';


Rule of thumb

ON → how tables connect

WHERE → which rows you want

4. Practice Examples (answers)
🧩 Practice 1: Employee → Manager

Requirement:
Show employee name and manager name.

SELECT
  e.name AS employee,
  m.name AS manager
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m
  ON e.manager_id = m.id;


Why LEFT JOIN?

Employees without managers (e.g. CEO) still appear

Manager column will be NULL

🧩 Practice 2: Order → Customer → Product

Requirement:
Show order id, customer name, and product name.

SELECT
  o.id AS order_id,
  c.name AS customer,
  p.product_name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
  ON o.customer_id = c.id
JOIN products p
  ON o.product_id = p.id;

5. Mental Model (super useful)

Think of JOINs like this:

“Start with this table → attach related data → then filter”

FROM A
JOIN B ON relationship
JOIN C ON relationship
WHERE conditions


--------------------------------Practice Basic Level Queries---------------------------------------


SELECT *
FROM customers o
JOIN orders c ON o.customerNumber = c.customerNumber
JOIN payments p ON o.customerNumber = p.customerNumber;

SELECT e1.phone AS employee, e2.customerName AS manager
FROM customers e1
JOIN customers e2
  ON e1.customerNumber = e2.customerNumber;


SELECT o.customerNumber, c.customerName
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
  ON o.customerNumber = c.customerNumber
WHERE c.country = 'USA';
