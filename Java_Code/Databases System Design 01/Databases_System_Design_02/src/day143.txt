Big Picture (2 minutes)

Isolation levels control how much one transaction can “see” of another transaction.

Think of multiple people editing the same Google Doc:

Low isolation → everyone sees half-typed sentences

High isolation → people wait their turn, slower but safer

Rule to remember forever:

🔼 Higher isolation = 🔒 more safety = 🐢 less performance

The 3 Classic Problems (Know These First)

Before levels, memorize the problems:

1️⃣ Dirty Read

Reading uncommitted data

Example:

T1 updates salary to 100k (not committed)

T2 reads 100k

T1 rolls back
❌ T2 read fake data

2️⃣ Non-Repeatable Read

Reading the same row twice, getting different values

Example:

T1 reads balance = 500

T2 updates balance to 300 and commits

T1 reads again → 300
❌ Value changed mid-transaction

3️⃣ Phantom Read

Rows appear or disappear

Example:

T1: SELECT * FROM orders WHERE amount > 100

T2 inserts a new order (amount = 150)

T1 runs same query again → extra row
❌ “Phantom” row appears

Isolation Levels (IN ORDER — VERY IMPORTANT)
🟢 1. Read Uncommitted (Lowest)

Prevents: ❌ Nothing

Can read uncommitted data

Dirty reads allowed

Almost never used in real systems

🧠 Interview line:

“Read Uncommitted allows dirty reads and is rarely used.”

🔵 2. Read Committed (Most Common)

Prevents: ✅ Dirty Reads
Allows: ❌ Non-repeatable reads, ❌ Phantom reads

Only reads committed data

Each query sees latest committed value

Example:

First read = 500

Second read = 300 (if someone committed in between)

🧠 Interview line:

“Read Committed prevents dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads.”

🟠 3. Repeatable Read

Prevents:
✅ Dirty Reads
✅ Non-Repeatable Reads
Allows: ❌ Phantom Reads (in theory)

Rows you read cannot change

Same row → same value every time

Example:

Balance read twice → always 500

🧠 Interview line:

“Repeatable Read guarantees stable row values but may allow phantom reads.”

👉 MySQL (InnoDB) actually prevents phantoms too — bonus interview point 😉

🔴 4. Serializable (Highest)

Prevents: ✅ All problems

Transactions behave as if they run one by one

Uses locks or transaction ordering

Safest but slowest

🧠 Interview line:

“Serializable provides full isolation at the cost of performance.”

🔥 SUPER IMPORTANT MAP (Memorize This)
Problem ↓      Isolation Level →
------------------------------------------
Dirty Read        Read Committed+
Non-repeatable    Repeatable Read+
Phantom           Serializable


OR another way:

Read Uncommitted  → nothing
Read Committed    → dirty reads
Repeatable Read   → dirty + non-repeatable
Serializable      → everything

How to Explain in an Interview (Say This Out Loud)

“Isolation levels control how transactions see each other’s data.
Read Uncommitted allows dirty reads.
Read Committed prevents dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads.
Repeatable Read ensures rows don’t change within a transaction.
Serializable is the highest level and prevents all anomalies but impacts performance.
Most systems use Read Committed or Repeatable Read for balance.”
