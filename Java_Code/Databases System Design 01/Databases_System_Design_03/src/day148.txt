What are Window Functions? (Plain English)

Window functions calculate something across a group of rows
➡️ without collapsing rows like GROUP BY does.

So you still see every row, but with extra insights added.

Think of it as:

“Look around this row at related rows, and compute something.”

Core Syntax (This part matters)
function() OVER (
  PARTITION BY column
  ORDER BY column
)

Breakdown:

function() → what you calculate (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, etc.)

PARTITION BY → how rows are grouped (like GROUP BY, but no collapsing)

ORDER BY → how rows are ranked or ordered inside each group

Example Table: employees
employee_id	department	salary
1	HR	60000
2	HR	70000
3	HR	70000
4	IT	80000
5	IT	75000
1️⃣ ROW_NUMBER()
What it does:

Gives a unique number

Always increases by 1

No ties (even if values are equal)

SELECT employee_id, department, salary,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
         PARTITION BY department
         ORDER BY salary DESC
       ) AS row_num
FROM employees;

Result (HR only):
salary	row_num
70000	1
70000	2
60000	3

✅ Use when you need:

“Top N rows per group”

De-duplication

Pagination

2️⃣ RANK()
What it does:

Same values → same rank

Skips numbers after ties

RANK() OVER (
  PARTITION BY department
  ORDER BY salary DESC
)

Result (HR):
salary	rank
70000	1
70000	1
60000	3

❗ Notice: rank 2 is skipped

✅ Use when:

Ranking matters

You want ties to share rank

3️⃣ DENSE_RANK()
What it does:

Same values → same rank

No gaps in ranking

DENSE_RANK() OVER (
  PARTITION BY department
  ORDER BY salary DESC
)

Result (HR):
salary	dense_rank
70000	1
70000	1
60000	2

✅ Use when:

You want clean consecutive ranks

🔥 Key Differences (Memorize This)
Function	Ties	Skips Numbers?
ROW_NUMBER	❌ No	❌ No
RANK	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
DENSE_RANK	✅ Yes	❌ No
Your Example Explained
SELECT employee_id, department, salary,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank_in_dept
FROM employees;


This means:

Split employees by department

Order salaries highest first

Rank employees inside each department

Keep all rows


------------------------------------------------Basic Simple Practice Query --------------------------------



	SELECT orderNumber, status, comments,
	       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
	         PARTITION BY status
	         ORDER BY orderNumber DESC
	       ) AS row_num
	FROM orders;



    SELECT  * ,
    RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY status
      ORDER BY orderNumber DESC
    ) AS ordersDetails
    FROM orders


    SELECT  * ,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY status
      ORDER BY orderNumber DESC
    )
    FROM orders
