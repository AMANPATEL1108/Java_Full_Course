//What is the main difference between the underlying data structures of an ArrayList and a LinkedList?
//->ArrayList get index thre we can get and LinkedList in that we can get from a prev and Next Threw
//How does the time complexity for accessing an element differ between ArrayList and LinkedList?
//->In ArrayList when first then O(1) else O(n)  ->in LinekedList head-tails O(1) else O(n)
//In which situation would you prefer using a LinkedList over an ArrayList?
//Linked List is when insertion and deletion is more then and ArrayList is then when we want to finding
//Why does inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an ArrayList take O(n) time, but in a LinkedList it is O(1) (if the node is already located)?
//->because of this one  Arraylist check one by one and Linked list previous and next threw then
//What happens when an ArrayList exceeds its capacity? How does it handle this situation?
//->in this they are double that value if size
//If you were to frequently add and remove elements from the beginning of a list, which implementation would be better, ArrayList or LinkedList? Why?
//->In first LinkedList
//What is the memory overhead of a LinkedList compared to an ArrayList?
//->LinkedList has more memory overhead because each node stores data + 2 references (next, prev). ArrayList stores only the data, so itâ€™s more memory efficient.
