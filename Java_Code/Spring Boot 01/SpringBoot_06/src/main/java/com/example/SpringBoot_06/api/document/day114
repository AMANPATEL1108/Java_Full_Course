JWT (JSON Web Token) is a popular method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It’s often used in modern web applications for handling authentication and authorization.

In Java, especially when using Spring Boot, JWT is typically used for authenticating and securing APIs. Here's a simple breakdown of the basics of JWT and how to integrate it into a Spring Boot application.

JWT Structure

A JWT is made up of three parts:

Header: Contains the type of the token (JWT) and the signing algorithm (e.g., HMAC SHA256, RSA).

Payload: Contains the claims, which are the statements about an entity (typically the user) and additional data. Claims can be public or private.

Signature: The header and payload are Base64Url encoded and then signed using a secret key or a private key (depending on the algorithm). This ensures the token’s integrity and authenticity.

Here’s a sample JWT:

xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz


xxxxx: Encoded header.

yyyyy: Encoded payload.

zzzzz: Encoded signature.

JWT Flow in Spring Boot

User Login: User provides their credentials (like username and password) to the server.

Generate JWT: If the credentials are valid, the server generates a JWT and sends it back to the client.

Client Stores JWT: The client stores the JWT (usually in local storage or as a cookie).

API Calls: For subsequent requests, the client includes the JWT in the HTTP Authorization header (Bearer <JWT>).

Server Validates JWT: The server checks if the JWT is valid and grants access to the requested resource.
