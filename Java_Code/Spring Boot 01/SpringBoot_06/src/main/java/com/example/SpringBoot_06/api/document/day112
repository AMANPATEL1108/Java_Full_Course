  1. Authentication (Who are you?)

  Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user.

  👉 It answers:

  “Are you really who you claim to be?”

  Examples

  Logging in with username & password

  Using JWT token

  OAuth2 login (Google, GitHub)

  API key authentication

  In Spring Boot

  Spring Security handles authentication using:

  AuthenticationManager

  AuthenticationProvider

  UserDetailsService

  Authentication object

  Example
  @Autowired
  AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;

  public void login(String username, String password) {
      Authentication auth = authenticationManager.authenticate(
          new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(username, password)
      );
  }


  If credentials are valid, authentication succeeds.
  If invalid, Spring throws an exception (BadCredentialsException).

  2. Authorization (What are you allowed to do?)

  Authorization happens after authentication.

  👉 It answers:

  “What actions or resources can you access?”

  Examples

  User can access /profile

  Admin can access /admin

  Only users with ROLE_MANAGER can delete records

  In Spring Boot

  Authorization is done using:

  Roles (ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_USER)

  Authorities / Permissions (READ, WRITE)

  Annotations like:

  @PreAuthorize

  @Secured

  @RolesAllowed

  Example
  @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
  @GetMapping("/admin")
  public String adminPage() {
      return "Admin Access";
  }

  3. Key Differences
  Authentication	Authorization
  Verifies identity	Verifies permissions
  Happens first	Happens after authentication
  Login process	Access control
  Example: Login	Example: Access /admin
  4. Authentication vs Authorization Flow in Spring Boot

  User sends login request

  Authentication

  Username & password checked

  JWT validated (if token-based)

  User is authenticated

  Authorization

  Spring checks roles/permissions

  Access granted or denied

  5. Real-World Analogy 🚪

  Authentication → Showing your ID card

  Authorization → Being allowed into specific rooms

  6. Summary

  ✅ Authentication = Identity verification

  ✅ Authorization = Permission check

  🔐 Both are essential for secure Spring Boot applications
